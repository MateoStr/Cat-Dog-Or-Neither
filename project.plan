# Project Name: AI-Powered Single Page Web Application
# Description: 
A web application with a Vue.js frontend and FastAPI backend for serving AI/ML models built with TensorFlow. 
The app will be containerized using Docker, deployed using Kubernetes, and hosted on AWS. 
It will use MySQL for the database and leverage cloud infrastructure for scalability.

# Planned Tech Stack:

## 1. Backend:
- **FastAPI**:
  - Responsible for serving APIs and AI model predictions.
  - Used for user authentication, managing data, and handling business logic.
  - Integrates async functionality for high-performance API endpoints.
  - Auto-generates interactive API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger.
  
- **SQLAlchemy**:
  - ORM for handling database operations with MySQL.
  - Used in conjunction with Pydantic for data validation and serialization.

- **Alembic**:
  - Handles database migrations for SQLAlchemy.

- **Pydantic**:
  - Used for data validation and serialization in API requests and responses.

## 2. Machine Learning:
- **TensorFlow**:
  - Used for building, training, and serving machine learning models.
  - FastAPI endpoints will handle AI inference for real-time predictions.

## 3. Frontend:
- **Vue.js**:
  - Single Page Application (SPA) for interacting with the backend.
  - Communicates with FastAPI through RESTful API endpoints.

## 4. Database:
- **MySQL**:
  - Relational database for storing structured data.
  - Managed through SQLAlchemy ORM.

## 5. Containerization:
- **Docker**:
  - Containerizes the FastAPI backend, machine learning models, and the Vue.js frontend.
  - Ensures consistent development, testing, and production environments.

## 6. Orchestration and Scaling:
- **Kubernetes**:
  - Manages containerized applications (FastAPI, database, etc.) in production.
  - Handles auto-scaling, load balancing, and deployment in production environments.
  - AWS **EKS** will be used for Kubernetes orchestration.

## 7. Cloud Infrastructure:
- **AWS** (Amazon Web Services):
  - **EC2**: Used for compute resources.
  - **S3**: For file storage and serving static assets.
  - **RDS**: Managed MySQL database.
  - **EKS**: For Kubernetes orchestration.
  - **AWS Lambda** (optional): Could be used for serverless ML inference tasks.

## 8. Authentication & Security:
- **OAuth2 / JWT**:
  - For secure user authentication and session management in FastAPI.

## 9. Version Control & CI/CD:
- **Git**:
  - Version control for all project code.
  
- **CI/CD Pipeline** (e.g., AWS CodePipeline, GitHub Actions):
  - Automates building, testing, and deploying the app to production.

# Considerations:
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Use Prometheus for monitoring and ELK Stack or AWS CloudWatch for logging.
- **Rate Limiting & Caching**: Consider Redis or Memcached for caching responses.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests using pytest for backend components.

Phase 1: =======    Project Setup and Environment Configuration
Set Up Version Control:

Create a repository in GitHub (or your preferred platform).
Set up Git locally and clone the repository.
Create a Development Environment:

Install Python and Node.js on your development machine.
Set up virtualenv or conda for Python to manage dependencies.
Set up npm or yarn for Vue.js frontend.
Initialize Backend and Frontend Projects:

For backend:
Initialize a FastAPI project.
Install FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, and Alembic.
For frontend:
Use Vue CLI to initialize a Vue.js project.
Set Up Docker:

Write Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml to containerize FastAPI and Vue.js projects.
Ensure each component (backend, frontend, database) runs in a container.
Prepare MySQL Database:

Install MySQL locally (or use a container in Docker).
Set up the initial database schema using SQLAlchemy and Alembic migrations.
Configure AWS:

Set up an AWS account and install AWS CLI.
Create resources like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and RDS databases.
Set up IAM roles and security policies for the app.


Phase 2: ================ Backend Implementation
Set Up FastAPI with Basic Routes:

Create basic routes and views to serve static content and test the backend.
Test API routes using Swagger auto-generated documentation.
Integrate Database (MySQL):

Write models using SQLAlchemy for the database.
Set up Alembic for database migrations.
Implement data validation and serialization with Pydantic models.
User Authentication:

Implement OAuth2 or JWT-based authentication in FastAPI.
Create login and registration routes with user management.
TensorFlow Model Integration:

Load and serve TensorFlow machine learning models in FastAPI.
Set up API endpoints to handle real-time predictions (inference) using the models.



Phase 3: =================   Frontend Implementation
Vue.js Project Setup:

Scaffold a Vue.js Single Page Application (SPA) using Vue CLI.
Install necessary dependencies for state management (Vuex) and routing (Vue Router).
Build Core Pages & Components:

Implement pages and components for the application (e.g., login, dashboard, prediction results).
Create forms and UI elements to communicate with the FastAPI backend.
Integrate Backend API:

Use Axios or Fetch API in Vue.js to communicate with the FastAPI backend.
Create services in Vue.js for interacting with backend routes (user management, ML inference).
State Management:

Implement Vuex for managing global state (e.g., user authentication and session data).
Integrate user data and authentication flow between the frontend and backend.



Phase 4: =================   Containerization and Orchestration
Dockerize the Application:

Write Dockerfiles for both the FastAPI backend and Vue.js frontend.
Update the docker-compose.yml file to include both services and the MySQL database.
Build and run containers locally to ensure all services work together.
Set Up Kubernetes:

Define Kubernetes manifests (YAML) for deploying your containers in a cluster.
Set up Kubernetes locally (using minikube or k3s) to test deployments.
Deploy the app components (FastAPI, Vue.js, MySQL) to Kubernetes.
AWS EKS Setup:

Configure AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) to deploy the application.
Use kubectl to manage and monitor deployments in AWS.
Set up Kubernetes Ingress for handling external traffic to your app.



Phase 5: ================   Deployment and Scaling
Set Up CI/CD Pipeline:

Implement automated deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline.
Automate building, testing, and deploying Docker images to AWS EKS.
AWS Infrastructure:

Set up EC2 for hosting the compute resources.
Use RDS for the managed MySQL database.
Set up S3 for static file storage.
Optional: Set up AWS Lambda for serving TensorFlow models if you prefer serverless.
Scaling:

Implement auto-scaling on Kubernetes for handling high loads.
Use AWS CloudWatch or Prometheus for monitoring performance and health.

Phase 6: ================   Testing and Optimization
Write Unit and Integration Tests:

Use pytest to write unit tests for FastAPI endpoints and business logic.
Write integration tests to verify that the frontend (Vue.js) and backend (FastAPI) communicate properly.
Set Up Caching and Rate Limiting:

Integrate Redis or Memcached in FastAPI for caching frequent requests.
Implement rate-limiting on API endpoints for performance optimization.
Security Review:

Perform a security audit on authentication, data storage, and APIs.
Implement HTTPS, and set up SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt.



Phase 7: =================    Monitoring, Logging, and Final Deployment
Monitoring and Logging:

Set up Prometheus for monitoring application metrics and system health.
Implement logging with AWS CloudWatch or ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana).
Final Deployment to Production:

Run the final deployment of the app to AWS EKS.
Ensure all services (FastAPI, Vue.js, TensorFlow) are functioning and scaling as expected.
Post-Deployment Monitoring:

Continuously monitor application performance, API traffic, and server health.
Set up alerts for critical issues using AWS CloudWatch or Prometheus.


Phase 8: ==============     Maintenance and Future Enhancements
Performance Tuning:

Identify any performance bottlenecks and optimize them (e.g., query optimization, API caching).
Use load testing tools like Apache JMeter to assess performance under high traffic.
Feature Expansion:

Plan and implement additional features, such as new machine learning models or additional front-end components.
Keep updating the application with bug fixes, performance improvements, and security patches.
